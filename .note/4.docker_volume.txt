1. docker volumes are stored in /var/lib/docker/volumes
    Annoymous volumes can accumulate to take large amount of disk space

2. commands:
    docker volume
    docker volume ls
    docker volume prune - prunes the Annoymous volumes

3. docker run
    With "docker run --rm" option, docker automatically removes the container and its associated anonymous volumes when it exits

4. docker compose
    Annoymous volumes are not deleted when "docker compose down" by default
        "--volumes" option is needed to let "docker compose down" also clear the Annoymous volumes

5. We can always "docker volume prune" to clean the annoymous volumes
