Install docker from Nexus
------------------------------
1. Add the public APT docker repository as instructed - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
2. Find the repository "list" file in etc/apt/sources.list.d/ for docker.list (The file may have an extension "distUpgrade". if so, remove the extension)
3. Change the package download URL to "https://nexus.ci.{domain-name}.app/repository/{company-name}-cne-ubuntu-docker-jammy jammy stable"
    - the ubuntu version name can be adjusted
4. Do not need to change the signed-by keyrings
5. Then the packages will be downloaded from nexus, not "https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu" anymore
