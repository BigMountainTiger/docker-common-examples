docker network ls
docker run has --network option, default is bridge

Docker defaut networks
1. bridge => Default, an isolated network for the containers
    - need -p 80:90 to export the port to the host, so the port is accessible from the host
    - DNS available within the isolated network
    - By default, docker-compose automatically create a bridge network. To stop it, add "network_mode: bridge/host" to all the services (containers)

2. host => directly get a port from the host
3. none => If no network is needed for the container

The above 3 are the most commonly used network modes

1. bridge => The default network driver.
2. host => Remove network isolation between the container and the Docker host.
3. none =>	Completely isolate a container from the host and other containers.
4. overlay => Overlay networks connect multiple Docker daemons together.
5. ipvlan => IPvlan networks provide full control over both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.
6. macvlan => Assign a MAC address to a container.
